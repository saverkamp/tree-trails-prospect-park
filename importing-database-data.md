# Importing data into Memento
Before starting you should have ready the two datasets for import, tree_species.csv and tree_trails.csv.  

Memento is available for Android (or desktop) only, but if you are using an iPhone, there may be a similar database app for which these datasets will work.  

### Download and install Memento if you haven't yet already.
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luckydroid.droidbase&hl=en_US)
- [Desktop](https://mementodatabase.com/)

### Create the Memento libraries
Download the template schemas for Tree Trails in Prospect Park by going to the Memento home screen, select "Catalog templates" from the upper left navigation, then search for "Tree Trails in Prospect Park." Select the download option in the lower right. This will also download the Tree species library template.

### Import the data
- Download the tree_species.csv and tree_trails.csv files to an accessible location on your phone (Downloads folder will work just fine.)
- From the Memento home screen, click into the "Tree species" library. In the upper right options, select the options icon to the right of "Edit library" and select "Import and export >"
Select "Import from CSV" and navigate to the "tree_species.csv" file on your phone. Make sure "Field delimiter" is set to "," and "Text qualifier" is set to " and select "IMPORT".
- Return to the Memento home screen and follow the previous instruction for the "Tree trails" library, importing the "tree_trails.csv" file.   

### Using the app
You can now use the "Tree trails" library to follow tours and document the trees you find. 
- Filter on specific tours by swiping left and selecting "Filters".
- For each entry, clicking on the "Tree species" field will take you to the corresponding entry in the "Tree species" library, which contains links to the tree's Wikipedia page, images in Wikimedia Commons, and its iNaturalist page, all of which can help you to identify the tree listed in the tour stop.
- In each entry, you can click the edit icon in the upper right to use Google Maps to add the geographic coordinates of the tree (defaults to current location), add images, indicate the status of the tree--Living, Dead, or Can't locate--or add any notes.
- Once you've added locations to your data, you can view the tour as a map by swiping left from the tour stop list and selecting "View" > "Map". You can also view as cards or as a table.
