INTRODUCTION,Here is an invitation to an outdoor...,"Here is an invitation to an outdoor adventure.

Learning to recognize trees on an unmarked trail is like a treasure hunt. We provide the clues: you have the fun of following them. If you lose the trail, backtrack to a numbered lamp post and try again. The numbers are on small bands about three feet above ground, just below the ornamental wreath which separates the shaft of the lamp post from its base.

Beginners are advised to concentrate on the trees most frequently planted in Prospect Park: oaks, lindens, sophora, maples, tulip trees. If you learn only two trees on your first outing, choose the white oak and the tulip tree. These appear on all the tours, sometimes more than once. When you are sure of these guideposts, you will find the next tour easier to follow.

There is no typical leaf form any more than there is a typical New Yorker. For this reason, a pictured leaf can give only a hint of the variations to be found within a species or even on the same tree. Beginners tend to rely too much on leaf form, sometimes missing easier and more constant keys such as bark or fruit. With practise, the separate characteristics -- leaves, bark, twigs, buds, fruit, and branching habit -- begin to merge into a single impression. You will find yourself recognizing trees, as you do your friends, at a glance.

Tour I is equally divided between native and exotic trees and serves as introduction to the most frequently encountered trees in the Park, as well as to the rarest, the Camperdown elm. On Tour II, natives outnumber exotics two to one. There are two opportunities to compare and review the native oaks, and to admire the oldest tree in Prospect Park, the great American elm on the Nethermead. Tour III contains twice as many exotics as natives. Many of these are moderate growers like magnolias and flowering cherries.These and two outstanding Japanese cut-leaf maples are of particular interest to home gardeners. Tour IV is put last because it leaves the security of paths and numbered lamp posts and ventures into uncharted territory. You are very likely to get lost. If you can puzzle out the route, you will discover some trees not found on any of the other tours.Once again on the path, towards the end of the tour, there is an especially good opportunity to compare three different European lindens in a close grouping, with an American linden or basswood nearby for contrast.

The trees in Prospect Park are of superlative size and beauty. The Park itself is the finest naturalistic landscape park in the country. Its history, design, and architecture are fully described and pictured in the . . .Prospect Park Handbook by Clay Lancaster, first curator of Prospect Park.

These trees are extremely showy when in bloom, as their spires of white flowers stand upright on the ends of the branches like candles on a giant's Christmas tree. The shiny brown nuts are not edible.",Aesculus hippocastanum,TOUR 1,5

The Park contains a number of oak species and offers an excellent opportunity of studying the characteristics of different oaks and learning how to identify them. The <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">white oak</i> is recognized by the rounded lobes and sinuses of the leaves -- characteristics of the <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">white oak</i> group as a whole -- and specifically by the pale bark which peels off in flakes that become larger and looser towards the top of the tree.",Quercus alba,TOUR 1,6

Its neatly designed leaves closely resemble those of the English oak, Q. robur. The acorns are of exceptional beauty. The nuts are long, slender, and highly polished, and are set off by an extravagantly bristled cup. This specimen is in urgent need of care. Recommended treatment would include shaping the ragged wounds on the trunk for rapid healing, removing the many dead limbs, and keeping all exposed sapwood sealed with tree paint to guard against fungus infection.",Quercus cerris,TOUR 1,7

Like other members of the red oak group, the <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">pin oak</i>'s leaves are sharply pointed and toothed. Their small size and deep indentations give an airy appearance. Slender twigs and the drooping habit of the lower branches are added clues to identification.",Quercus palustris,TOUR 1,9

The <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">box elder</i> is neither boxwood, alder, nor elderberry but is a kind of maple having three separate leaflets instead of a single leaf. Though the leaves are not easily recognized as belonging to a maple, the chains of winged key fruits are proof of identity.",Acer negundo,TOUR 1,10

This is a Japanese umbrella pine or Tanyosho pine, Pinus densiflora umbraculifera. Compare the brightness of this pine's foliage with the somber cast of the white pines at the entrance. The flat top of the Tanyosho is formed by the nearly uniform height of its upright branches. In the white pine, horizontal branches may give a flat-topped effect. The strong-growing yew needs heading back where it is crowding the choicer Tanyosho pine.",Taxus cuspidata,TOUR 1,11

Ashes are of separate sexes. If you see the winged nutlets on an ash you are sure that it is a pistillate or female tree. This specimen is pistillate. Even when the fruits have disappeared, you can see thousands of stiff strings on which they grew. Sportsmen should view the ash special affection. Its wood is nearly as strong as that hickory but much lighter in weight. It is extensively used for the frames of rowboats, canoes, and tennis racquets, and for oars, paddles, and baseball bats.",Fraxinus americana,TOUR 1,13

These are members of the pea family. The smaller trees are presumably seedlings of the older specimens. When covered with a froth of greenish white flowers in August, a season when little else is in bloom, sophoras are the Park's most conspicuous ornament.",Styphnolobium japonicum,TOUR 1,14

The pendulous top of the mulberry, a freak or sport, would sprawl on the ground if allowed to grow normally. In order to create a fountain effect, the drooping variety is grafted on understock of normal upright mulberry. Weeping cherries and the Camperdown elm which we will see presently are produced by the same method.",Buxus sempervirens,TOUR 1,15

Their smooth reddish bark is distinctive.",Taxus baccata,TOUR 1,17
Himalayan pine (Pinus wallichiana),Walk through the arch....,"Walk through the arch. As you come out, look up to your left into the long, hanging needles of a <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Himalayan pine</i>, <b><i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Pinus wallichiana</i></b> (syn. P. griffithii). This is a rare pine, one of the finest, and worth a moment's close study. Its needles are in bundles of five, indicating that it belongs to the white pine group. There can be no confusion with our native white pine, Pinus strobus, which has stiff, short needles that reveal the tiered outline of the horizontal branches. In contrast, the branch structure of the <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Himalayan pine</i> is obscured by a veil of soft, drooping needles. It is strange that this pine, bred in the clean air of the Himalayas, can thrive in the city's contaminated atmosphere. Our native white pine barely survives in the city. The sickly specimen on the bank at your right is a striking contrast to the flourishing Himalayan.
Because of the steepness of the bank and lack of soil-holding shrubs, earth had washed away and exposed the roots of the Himalayan pine to a degree that threatened its stability. Stakes were driven into the bank in an effort to prevent further erosion. This has been only partially successful. A barrier planting of thorny shrubs is needed at the top of the bank to close off the damaging short cut down the slope. The roots need a dressing of topsoil, a mulch of wood chips, and a prickly cover -- perhaps a pegged-down pyracantha -- to prevent trampling. In addition, the straggly yew which is bruising the pine's lower branches should be drastically cut back or removed. This Himalayan pine, the largest specimen on Long Island, is worth making every effort to preserve.",Pinus wallichiana,TOUR 1,18
Camperdown elm (Ulmus glabra 'camperdownii'),"On your right, the widespread tree ...","On your right, the widespread tree surrounded by a fence is the famous <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Camperdown elm</i>. This is a treasure of the highest order, quite surely the most distinguished tree in the city and possibly in the state. It is a prostrate form of Scotch elm, Ulmus glabra, which has been grafted on a short trunk of normal Scotch elm. Technically this is a weeping tree but unlike the rather flimsy mulberry previously noted, the elm develops limbs that ascend, twist, and curve back on themselves to make a branch pattern of the utmost force, and intricacy.
This specimen is a vegetative descendent of a Scotch elm seedling that failed to develop a normal trunk but crept along the ground. It originated at Camperdown House, the estate of the Earl of Camperdown, near Dundee, Scotland. All Camperdown elms trace back to this one plant which was introduced to cultivation in 1850. Our tree must have been one of the first to be grafted since it is estimated to be over one hundred years old.
On one of the walking tours conducted by the Friends of Prospect Park, it was discovered that the Camperdown elm was gravely threatened by decay resulting from years of neglect and faulty pruning. The main horizontal limb on the Boat House side was a mere shell, hollow to the base, and further weakened by a great untreated wound. The Friends of Prospect Park, unwilling to let the cherished tree die for lack of care, called in the Bartlett Tree Company for diagnosis and estimates, then launched an appeal for funds. People who care deeply about the Park's trees welcomed the opportunity of taking an active part in preserving them. Through voluntary contributions, the Camperdown Fund in its first year was able to treat its namesake and three other notable trees as well.

All elms are susceptible to Dutch elm disease though in varying degrees. The chief protection for healthy elms is to keep them in thriving condition, clear of dead branches, and sprayed against beetles. Even more important is the practise of strict sanitation, which requires the removal and burning of every infected tree as soon as the disease is diagnosed. This is the only way to destroy the new crop of beetles which would otherwise emerge in early spring to carry the deadly fungus to another elm. A large elm can serve as breeding ground for three million bark beetles. It takes only one to kill a tree.
Infected elms left standing until their beetles emerge in early May are a threat to the life of every elm within a two-mile radius -- the Camperdown elm included. However, if the Camperdown had been abandoned to decay, it was quite certainly doomed. Reinforced, pruned, filled, and fed, it has a sporting chance of giving pleasure to future generations of Park visitors. Those who know and love the tree believe that the investment for professional care is a gamble worth the taking.
On the hill beyond the Camperdown elm, in the direction of the Boat House, is a large sophora of imposing form. Usually a high-branched tree, this one has stout horizontal branches thrusting out near the base.",Ulmus glabra 'Camperdownii',TOUR 1,19
Red maple (Acer rubrum),Walk towards the Boat House to the ...,"Walk towards the Boat House to the end of the grassy triangle, then turn towards the lake around lamp post M 120. Looking across the triangle with your back to the Boat House, you will see a tree with six trunks, a multiple-stemmed <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">red maple</i>, <b><i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Acer rubrum</i></b>. Ordinarily <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">red maple</i>s have only one trunk so this individual is quite uncommon.",Acer rubrum,TOUR 1,20

The zebra-striped bark of this <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">hornbeam</i> always excites interest and admiration. In summer the tree is hung with chains of fruits made up of three-lobed bracts in pairs, each with a nutlet in its base.",Carpinus betulus,TOUR 1,21

At the far end of the triangle, by lamp post M 122, is another <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">European hornbeam</i> with so many trunks that it resembles a tropical banyan. This tree, disfigured and endangered by dead limbs, cavities, and jagged stubs, has been pruned and fertilized by the Bartlett Tree Company through the Camperdown Fund.",Carpinus betulus,TOUR 1,22

On your left is a <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">European larch</i>, <b><i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Larix decidua</i></b>. Like the bald cypress, this is one of the very few ""evergreens"" that loses its needles in winter. The tree is most attractive in spring when its budding needles resemble pale green chenille. The developing cones, bright crimson in color, look like tiny rosebuds set along the branches. The larch has a second brief season of beauty in autumn when the whole tree turns amber yellow before the needles are shed.

The larch's poor condition, dead branches, and meager growth plainly reflected the hardships of its situation on a bare slope of hard-packed clay. Contributions to the Camperdown Fund made it possible to prune and feed the larch. Soil texture would be improved by a planting of prickly shrubs such as blackberries to prevent further compaction by foot traffic, and by a mulch of humus-forming material.",Larix decidua,TOUR 1,23
Red maple (Acer rubrum),To the right of the bridge is a mor...,"To the right of the bridge is a more normal <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">red maple</i>, this time with only one extra trunk. As it leans out from the bank, the arch of its branches repeats the curve of the bridge, while the foliage -- especially striking in its autumnal red -- is mirrored in the Lullwater. Because of the prominence of its situation, this tree will be the focal point of the view from the Boat House terrace when the long-promised restoration is actually accomplished. The maple was slated for surgery in 1967 to treat a dead crown and cavities in the trunk. However, the Bartlett expert advised waiting to see whether the tree suffers injury to its roots when the retaining wall is built and the lake dredged. Since work on the maple had to be postponed, the money allotted for its care was applied to the historic American elm on the border of the Nethermead. This elm is described in Tour II.",Acer rubrum,TOUR 1,24

In the angle of the paths is a <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">black haw</i>, <b><i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">Viburnum prunifolium</i></b>, one of our handsomest native shrubs. It is variable in form and sometimes attains the stature of a small tree as this one does. It can be identified by the pattern of its bark, a mosaic of small scalelike flakes, very like the bark of a dogwood but in reduced scale. The foliage turns a glowing rose-wine color in autumn.

At the next fork, turn right at the drinking fountain and walk towards East Wood Arch. The banks on either side of the approach are protected by a simple fence, inconspicuous and effective. Trees and understory shrubs are flourishing and seeding themselves in the untrampled soil. The grove holds fallen leaves which, as they decay, return vital chemicals to the soil and renew its humus content. Notice especially the large beech on the crest of the rise to the right, near lamp post M 215. Its trunk is surrounded by a thicket of youngsters, either seedlings or sucker growth from the roots. Here the forest is renewing itself, as it can do only in congenial soil and in a spot protected from compaction.

As you walk under East Wood Arch, the view on the far side presents an unhappy contrast. With neither fence nor shrubs to protect the surface, the barren slopes are packed hard by unrestricted traffic, exposed to drying from sun and wind, and severely eroded. The effect of root injury to the magnificent trees in this area is painfully evident.",Viburnum prunifolium,TOUR 1,29

Dark rough bark and massive branches are quick guides to identification. The broad leaves end in sharp points, indicating membership in the red oak group. This oak is stag-headed, meaning that its dead crown and leafless upper limbs stand out like antlers against the sky. Prompt improvement of this disadvantaged site, with a fence, a thick planting of shrubs, mulching, and fertilizer, plus pruning of the tree, would possibly save the superb oak from destruction. It would be foresighted, however, to plant a young specimen in the vicinity for future replacement.",Quercus velutina,TOUR 1,30

Like the black oak, the <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">tulip tree</i>s show the effects of hardship. Roots are exposed where soil has washed from the bare bank, and their thin bark has been damaged by thoughtless walkers.",Liriodendron tulipifera,TOUR 1,31

The one to the left was unusually tall but the top has died as a result of drought, mechanical injury to the tender bark, and hard-packed soil. The still-unspoiled forest northeast of the Music Pagoda would be a sanctuary for dogwoods, as this untamed wilding grows best in undisturbed woodlands.",Cornus florida,TOUR 1,32

The largest is unusually tall. One of its branches hangs low over the path so that you can examine its foliage at close range. The leaves are so slender and their edges so smooth that they might easily be mistaken for willow leaves. If you find tassels of male flowers or acorns, you will know this for a true oak. Since it has the appeal of novelty as well as of beauty, the <i style=""color: rgb(156, 39, 176);"">willow oak</i> should be planted more frequently than it is.",Quercus phellos,TOUR 1,33

A mountain of earth was bulldozed against the birch in June, 1967, cutting off air and water from its roots. Roots buried under even six inches of earth will suffocate, critically weakening a tree within a year and killing it in two. Grosser abuse will destroy it more rapidly. Shortly after the damage was done, the Park Department was notified of the threat to the birch and was urged to order immediate removal of the earth to prevent irreparable injury to the tree.",Betula lenta,TOUR 1,38

Its age is estimated by the Bartlett Tree Company as well over three hundred years. This elm was therefore a mature tree when George Washington's outnumbered forces fought their gallant retreat across this field on August 27, 1776. With the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Long Island approaching, it is more than ever essential to preserve this magnificent elm as a living monument.

In the early 1930's, the Park's arboriculturist, John Herlihy, supervised WPA work on the elm. The 20 foot cavity in the trunk was cleaned and filled and the enormous spreading canopy was reinforced with rods and cables to prevent splitting.

In the fall of 1967, the elm was given deep root feeding through the Camperdown Fund, a program organized by the Friends of Prospect Park to save the Park's historic trees. The Fund's resources in its first year were not sufficient to cover necessary pruning. This is a goa1 for tree lovers, patriots, and historians in 1968.

Elms have extremely shallow root systems which are especially vulnerable to injury from compacted soil. A temporary fence and mulching would loosen the soil, admit air and water, and encourage the growth of new feeding roots.

Before you leave, walk into the meadow for a full view of this truly noble tree, and bow to the memory of John Herlihy whose wise concern saved the great elm for your enjoyment and wonder.

The path ends at a place where the road was straightened in August 1967, for the benefit of speeding automobiles. Among other trees, a superb Sophora japonica was sacrificed. This was the finest of its species in the Park, with heavy, sculptural burls that gave it a look of great antiquity.

Stand here for a moment to watch the traffic. It violates the tranquility of Olmsted and Vaux's pastoral landscape, designed as a refuge from the noise, rush, and smells of the city. Deterioration of our parks will continue as long as automobiles are given priority over trees and grass.

If you visit Prospect Park on a day when automobiles are banned and bicycles silently skim the roads, you will enjoy the mood of quiet relaxation for which Prospect Park was designed.

Going through the Zoo to Flatbush Avenue and turning right, you come to the Lefferts Homestead, a farmhouse dating from the Revolutionary war and eminently worth a visit. The Homestead is furnished with antiques of the period, many of them provided by the Fort Greene Chapter of the D.A.R. . . .

Even today complaint is made that the drives are not wide enough and we understand that the Department is constantly pressed to enlarge them. Once already it has yielded to such pressure and widened a considerable stretch of road, destroying many of the finest trees on the ground in order to do so, and readjusting walks and other features to the injury of the rural character of the ground.

Turn around at this high point for a good view of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, then walk back towards Endale Arch.

In early June the styrax is hung with pointed white bells set with a yellow clapper and carrying a delicious fragrance. The styrax has clean, trim foliage and is highly recommended as a decorative tree for small properties. It looks its best when pruned to a single trunk, limbed high enough so that one can walk under its arching branches to view the massed flowers against the sky.

Go through the arch: the Long Meadow stretches before you. This is Prospect Park's most renowned feature, a mile-long sweep of unspoiled countryside, the largest expanse of grassland in any city park the world over.

Here the tree tour ends. Before you leave, climb the little rise by lamp post 102 for a final look at Long Meadow through its screen of trees.

The Long Meadow is five times as large as any in Central Park. It is the crowning expression of Olmsted and Vaux's purpose: to create an oasis of peace and refreshment, a refuge from the congestion of the city. A feeling of freedom and limitless space is achieved, in Olmsted's words, by ""a broad stretch of slightly undulating meadow without defined edges, its turf lost in a maze of the shadows of scattered trees. . . .""

As a further enticement, the extent of the Long Meadow is not fully revealed. Instead, it sweeps around low hills and out of sight, hinting at endless distance and adventures in the fields beyond.

I saw the setting sun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine wood. Its golden rays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble hall. I was impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining family had settled there. . . . If it were not for such families as this, I think I should move out of Concord. 
Henry David Thoreau: Walking, 1862

. . . Every bit of work done on the Park should be done for the single purpose of making the visitor feel as if be had got far away from the town.

In more palatable form, sassafras is an ingredient of root beer. Its dried leaves may perhaps still be used for making sassafras tea.

""In the years to come, man will be overwhelmingly a city animal. He will find nature in the city; or he will be in danger of not finding it at all. New York City is fortunate in its natural areas. Men of large vision and bold capacity to act created Central Park when the city had not grown northward of Thirtieth Street, and Prospect Park when Brooklyn was still a grouping of villages and neighborhoods.""

August Heckscher, Commissioner of Parks, 1967

Major changes are taking place in Prospect Park even as this booklet is being printed.Some trees mentioned in the text have died, victims of longstanding neglect or drought.To balance the loss, the Park has gained a director who is genuinely concerned with the sorry condition of the landscape and is taking energetic action to improve its care.

Among the tree casualties are the Turkey oak near the start of Tour I and the quaintly deformed black cherry noted on Tour III. The former was a rare and fine tree, the latter of value primarily as a marker to confirm the route. In addition, and most regrettably, the majority of bald cypresses in the Park, including the specimen described [in] Tour IV, are in critical condition. The severe droughts of 1965-6 have caused what may be irreversible damage to the roots of those moisture-loving trees. The surviving roots are not able to take up enough water to support a full crop of needles. The scanty foliage in turn cannot manufacture enough food to promote growth of a new root system, and so the life of the bald cypresses hangs in uncertain balance.

The new Park Director is James Linden. He has undertaken to repair the havoc caused by decades of ignorance and apathy. As a start, trees near the Willink Entrance are being cleared of dead wood. In the care of trees, however, no amount of energy and good will can take the place of technical competence. Without a trained horticulturist to direct the program, results are hit-and-miss and may in fact cause as much harm as cure. Heavy limbs, instead of being roped harmlessly down, were sawed off to crash on branches below. The ragged stub of the hornbeam has been cut off but extensive fungus infection persists in the limb and probably in the main trunk. Needless mutilation of low branches and shrubbery is still prevalent. A portion of the earth mound has been removed from the cherry birch near the carousel but buried roots on the north side are still suffocating.

Prospect Park, a masterpiece of landscape art, demands the same level of skilled care as the art treasures in our museums. Preserving an ancient tree, like cleaning a Rembrandt, is a job for an expert. The Park's heritage of magnificent trees requires professional care -- the informed attention of a full-time horticultural director to train and supervise a crew of Park Department employees.

Until this vital post is filled, Mr. Linden needs and deserves the help of all friends of Prospect Park. When you notice dead or broken limbs, rotting stubs, erosion from roots, untreated wounds, or insect damage, make a report in writing to Mr. Linden, enclosing a rough sketch of the locality and, if possible, the number of a nearby lamp post. The address is Litchfield Villa, Prospect Park West at 5th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215.

A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHOR,A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHOR: M. M. GRAF...,"A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHOR: M. M. GRAFF, THIRTY YEARS LATER

Shortly after becoming Curator of Prospect Park in January of 1966, I received a letter from Mildred M. Graff -- better known by and with the preferred name of Dicky -- volunteering her services in the park. Dicky was an expert on horticulture, botany in general, and especially on the subject of trees. She had been a suburban gardener for years, had recently moved to Brooklyn, and her book Flowers in the Winter Garden had just been published by Doubleday. We arranged a meeting, and through harmony of personalities and mutual interests became fast friends. I first made use of her expertise by asking her to read and criticize the section on trees in my Prospect Park Handbook that was published in 1967. When the book appeared Dicky joined in promoting its distribution. 

Soon afterwards Dicky Graff became director of the Camperdown Fund, formed to solicit resources for professional care of the century old trees in the park. It was named after the unique bonsai-looking Camperdown elm set out near Prospect Park's Cleft Ridge Span in 1872. Brooklyn's famous poet, Marianne Moore, who had been active in the fight to save the nearby Boathouse since 1964, wrote a poem on this Camperdown elm. She and Dicky soon became bosom companions. Miss Moore also had composed a foreword for the Prospect Park Handbook, and, following her death, Mrs. Graff penned a second foreword for the paperback edition of the Handbook published in 1972. It was a touching and informative tribute to the poet, entitled ""Remembering Marianne Moore."" 

The most pleasant of my memories regarding Dicky Graff is our sharing the leadership of the Prospect Park walking tours. She joined me during the third season, in 1968. We handed the bullhorn back and forth at every stop, I pointing out the design features of the park, and Dicky supplying information about the trees and plantings. I learned as much from her as any of the tour participants. 

Tree Trails in Prospect Park, published by Greensward Foundation in 1968, is dedicated to Marianne Moore. Dicky's coauthor was George Kalmbacher, taxonomist at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Dicky's Tree Trails in Central Park appeared in 1970, and she shared authorship with Thomas Hanley for Rock Trails in Central Park in 1976. Dicky produced two booklets in 1982, The Men Who Made Central Park and The Making of Prospect Park, which studies led to a monumental work three years later: Central Park -- Prospect Park, a New Perspective. It was innovative in giving credit for the parks' special feature where they belonged, many of them to heretofore unrecognized talents. 

For her efforts in maintaining and replacing the natural amenities of the two great city parks, and for promoting an understanding and appreciation of them through the spoken and written word, it is fitting that we honor M. M. Graff on this thirtieth anniversary of publication of Tree Trails in Prospect Park.
